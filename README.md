# React Final Project

## [Live Preview](https://ilyaeru.github.io/React-Final-Project/)

In this project, I have created a web application for managing a store.
The store manages data (with Redux and Firebase) about customers, products and purchases.

The application has the following functionality:

- The user can add a new purchase to a customer.
- The user can edit a customer or a product.
- The user can delete a customer or a product.
- The user can see a table of customers and products.
- The user can see customer's purchases.
- The user can see product's purchases.
- The user can see a table of purchases and filter by product, customer and date.
